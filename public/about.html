<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>My name is Oubaida Eziazi, you can call me Obaidah. I am a researcher student in Electronics Engineering.
  I do graphic design, programming, web development and design as hobbies and side hustling. I enjoy trying and learning new 
  experiences, and whether I'm doing it alone or with a friend, I always care about going through the full experience.</p>

<h4>My Life</h4>
<p>Just like a lot of people, I spent my childhood transfering from a school to another. However, it was amazing to get
  to know new people every time! And of course, some faces are never forgotten! I spent my school years learning in Arabic schools
  until I graduated from Al Israa Private School in United Arab Emirates (UAE). <br/>
  
  As a passioante and ambitious person, I kept looking for the major of my dreams as I had interests in lots of fields,
  especially in Engineering and Technology. However, it didn't matter how much of an ambitious person I am to my parents,
  so instead of impressing them I thought of impressing myself and going after what I want, the way I want, and of course, 
  after searching for the correct steps that I should be following. Which obviously means that I want to be following the steps
  of those who did it, the masters.
